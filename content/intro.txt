You are the eldest child of a large ducal family who lost their title due to war. After the fall, all of your siblings, who hated the restrictive noble life and controlling parents, all managed to flee by disguising themselves. As the eldest, you told all of your siblings to live out their life their way. Time passed, and you managed to maintain contact with your siblings. Until one day, the messages stopped coming in, and you have received news that all of them have been kidnapped by mysterious people. As an adventurer and the eldest sibling, it is now your job to save them!

However, when you reach the dungeons where they are supposedly held captive, dark magic rituals practised by the kidnappers have turned them all into monsters. Defeat the monsters to free your siblings!
