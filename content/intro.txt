You are the eldest child of a large ducal family who lost their title due to war. Your siblings and cousins, who are close to each other despite all our warring parents, hated the restrictive noble life and wanted freedom. After the fall, all of  them managed to flee by disguising themselves. As the eldest, you told them to live out their life the way that they always dream of: a life of freedom.

Time passed, and you managed to maintain contact with your family, who have gone their separate ways but still helped each other in times of need. Until one day, the messages stopped coming in, and you have received news that most of them have been kidnapped by mysterious people. As an adventurer and the eldest one, it is now your job to save them!

However, when you reach the dungeons where they are supposedly held captive, dark magic rituals practised by the kidnappers have turned them all into monsters. 
                                                   
Armed with your trusty sword, defeat the monsters to free your family!
