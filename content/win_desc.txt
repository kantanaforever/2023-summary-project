As your weakened father now lay on the floor, you can see his diminished figure clearly. The once regal-looking duke has now become a shrivelled person with sunken cheeks. In his final moments where his mind was cleared from the temptations of dark magics, he finally looked me in the eyes, and said, “Take care of your family…” 

With that, the light faded from his eyes as you ushered your siblings and/or cousins out of the dungeon with a heavy heart.

THE END!
